:100: A set of utilities for judging programs on Exercode (https://exercode.willbooster.com/).

## CLI

The package ships an `exercode-problem` command for problem authors (run it with `bun x` in a repository that depends on `@exercode/problem-utils`):

```bash
# Judge all model answers of all problems (directories containing problem.md or <id>.problem.md) under a directory.
# model_answers/* must be fully accepted; model_answers.fails/* must fail at least one test case.
bun x exercode-problem                # everything under the current directory
bun x exercode-problem courses/foo    # everything under courses/foo
bun x exercode-problem --only a_plus --skip gui_ --concurrency 2

# Judge one answer directory of the problem in the current directory.
bun x exercode-problem judge model_answers/python
bun x exercode-problem judge model_answers/python '{ "language": "python" }'

# Debug one answer directory of the problem in the current directory.
bun x exercode-problem debug model_answers/python '{ "stdin": "1 2" }'
```

`judge` and `debug` run a custom `judge.ts` / `debug.ts` when the problem has one, and apply `stdioJudgePreset` / `stdioDebugPreset` otherwise, mirroring the Exercode server. The debug fallback applies only to standard problems: a problem with a custom `judge.ts` needs its own `debug.ts`, and `exercode-problem debug` fails with a message otherwise (the server likewise reports debug as unsupported there).

The all-problem check judges serially by default because time limits are measured in wall-clock time; pass `--concurrency <n>` to parallelize when the checked problems are not timing-sensitive.

A standard stdin/stdout problem must NOT commit a `judge.ts` or `debug.ts` that is identical to the default stdio harness: the absence of `judge.ts` marks the problem as standard, and committed copies would drift from the server's defaults. The CLI rejects such files; a file kept intentionally (e.g. to demonstrate the default harness) can add an explanatory comment to be treated as custom.

## Validators

The CLI also validates learning-material files without running any program, mirroring the checks the Exercode importer applies:

```bash
# Validate problem directories (problem.md frontmatter, test_cases, model_answers, templates, judge.ts / debug.ts).
bun x exercode-problem validate-problem <problemDir>...
# Validate a course directory (course.yaml, lecture materials with embedded questions, problem references).
bun x exercode-problem validate-course <courseDir> [--problems-dir <dir>]
# Validate a contest (*.contest.yaml) file.
bun x exercode-problem validate-contest <contestYamlPath> [--problems-dir <dir>]
```

Each target prints `OK` or `NG` followed by its errors and warnings; the command exits 1 when any target has an error. `--problems-dir` points to the directory holding the referenced problems; a course is always searched at any depth, since Exercode links a material only to the problems inside its course, so for a course the option must name a directory inside it. The validators are also exported (`validateProblemDirectory`, `validateCourseDirectory`, `validateContestFile`, `validateMaterialFile`).

## Agent skills

The [`skills/`](skills/) directory holds skills for AI coding agents that author and review Exercode learning content: `generate-learning-content` (entry point), `generate-course-materials`, `generate-judge-problems`, `generate-judge-contest`, `review-learning-content`, and `setup-exercode-course-repository`. Agents working in this repository load them through the symlinks under `.claude/skills/`; install them elsewhere with the [skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI:

```bash
bun x skills add WillBooster/exercode-problem-utils --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

## Test cases

A problem keeps its test cases under `test_cases/`. A test case id is the shared name of the following entries, and each entry is optional:

| Entry          | Meaning                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<id>.in`      | Standard input. Omit it (or leave it empty) when the program reads nothing.                                                                       |
| `<id>.out`     | Expected standard output.                                                                                                                         |
| `<id>.fin/`    | Files copied into the working directory before the run (input files).                                                                             |
| `<id>.fout/`   | Expected output files, compared with the files of the same relative paths in the working directory.                                               |
| `_shared.fin/` | Files copied into the working directory before every test case.                                                                                   |
| `<id>.json`    | Configuration for a custom `judge.ts` that reads it itself; the presets ignore it (the Judge server lists it as a test case of the custom judge). |

A test case whose id contains `example` (the judge server's rule, e.g. `example_1` or `01_example_small`) is an example shown to learners; every other case is hidden.

Standard output and text files are compared as space-separated tokens: consecutive white spaces count as one separator, and an expected token that contains a decimal point and parses as a finite number (e.g. `3.14`, but not `1`, `1e-3` or `1.0e309`) accepts a value within an absolute or relative error of `1e-6`. A file is text when it is valid UTF-8 without NUL bytes; other files (e.g. images) must match byte for byte. A received file larger than 8 MiB counts as not produced, an expected file larger than 8 MiB is an authoring error (the case is reported as a runtime error), and a file larger than 1 MiB is left out of the reported pair. When a file differs, the result carries `<name>_expected.<ext>` and `<name>_received.<ext>` so Exercode can show both (Exercode decides per test case whether a learner may see them, as it does for expected stdout).

How a missing expectation is treated depends on the harness:

- `stdioJudgePreset` (the default for problems without `judge.ts`) requires `<id>.out` or a non-empty `<id>.fout/` for every test case, so a standard problem cannot accept a run without checking it. A problem whose `problem.md` declares `requiredOutputFilePaths` or `isManualScoringRequired` is exempt, because every test case is judged by those instead; code rules (`requiredRegExpsInCode` etc.) and `requiredSubmissionFilePaths` check the submission once, in addition to the output comparison, and do not exempt.
- `commandJudgePreset` without a `test` option checks whatever expectations exist, and a test case with neither only has to run within the limits. A `test` option replaces that comparison; it receives `testCase.output`, `testCase.fileOutputPath` and `cwd` and can call the exported `judgeAgainstExpectations` (or `compareStdoutAsSpaceSeparatedTokens` and `compareExpectedOutputFiles`). A custom `readTestCases` may return any test case type with `id` (plus optional `input` and `fileInputPath`); the default verdict judges any case that exposes a string `output` or `fileOutputPath`, which the default reader's `CommandTestCase` does.
- `guiCommandJudgePreset` passes the expectations to the problem's `test`, which decides everything.
- `llmJudgePreset` runs no program, so it copies no `.fin/`; it hands `<id>.in` as the prompt input and the whole entry (including `fileOutputPath`) to the problem's `test`.
- `stdioDebugPreset` copies the answer directory to a temporary directory and builds and runs it there together with `_shared.fin/` and the first example case's `.fin/` (the case's files win; hidden cases' inputs are never handed to learner code), so the answer directory is left untouched (its `node_modules`, and those of its ancestors, are linked into the copy rather than duplicated); files the program writes are reported only through `requiredOutputFilePaths`.
- `evaluationJudgePreset` does not use `test_cases/`.

`readTestCases` is exported for harnesses that enumerate `test_cases/` themselves.

## Measurements

`stdioJudgePreset`, `stdioDebugPreset`, and `commandJudgePreset` run a program under GNU time (`/usr/bin/time` on Linux, `gtime` on macOS) and report its wall time (`timeSeconds`), user plus system CPU time (`cpuTimeSeconds`), and peak resident set size (`memoryBytes`) in every test case result; `guiCommandJudgePreset` and `llmJudgePreset` report the wall time only. Time limits are judged by wall time. The CPU time is recorded even for a run that exceeded its limit, so a judge server sharing CPUs between programs can tell a program that used up its limit (its CPU time reaches the limit, so it would exceed it anywhere) from one that may only have waited for a CPU (its CPU time stays below the limit) and re-run just the latter alone.
